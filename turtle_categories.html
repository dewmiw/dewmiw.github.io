            Among the 250 species of turtles on Earth, seven of them live in the ocean and they're called sea
            turtles.The remaining 243 species live on land or in
            freshwater ponds and marshes. Five of the seven species of sea turtles namely the Green Turtle, Hawksbill
            Turtle , Olive Ridley , Loggerhead and Leatherback
            visit the Sri Lankan shores to nest. Three species of freshwater turtles, the Parker's Black Turtle, Sri
            Lanka Black Turtle and the Soft or Flapshell turtle and
            one terrestrial tortoise, the Star tortoise can also be found in Sri Lanka.

                            Green turtle, known for the greenish colour of its cartilage and fat, is one of the largest
                            sea turtles and the only herbivore, eating seagrass and algae, among the different species.
                            It is found mainly in the tropical and subtropical waters. Classified as endangered, green
                            turtles are threatened by hunting, overharvesting of their eggs,
                            being caught in fishing gear and by losing their nesting beaches.Green turtles grazing on
                            seagrasses and algae, maintains the seagrass beds and makes them
                            more productive. Green turtle nests all year round in Sri Lanka but they are abundantly
                            found in Kosgoda and Rekawa near Tangalle.

                            The Hawksbill Turtle is called so beacuse of the shape of its curved, pointed beak which
                            resembles that of a bird of prey.They spend most
                            of their life in the open ocean, but are more reef-associated than other species of sea
                            turtles.Unlike other sea turtles species,
                            Hawksbill turtles have home reefs where they spend most of their adult lives. Unfortunately,
                            this species is critically endangered.
                            There is a strong market for their beautiful shells.Hawksbill turtles are found in Kataduwa,
                            Bentota, Udappuwa, Kosgoda, Jaffna areas.

                            species come to the shore all at once to nest. Thids unique phenomena
                            is known as "arribada". Olive Ridleys mainly feed on jellyfish, shrimp, fish and mollusks
                            and has an average lifespan of about 50 years. they can be found
